1. Run `bundle install`.
2. Create a `run.rb` file in the parent directory.
3. Inside the `run.rb` file, require all the model files and pry.
4. Write seed data and method tests.

Note: This lab is behavior-driven development, not test-driven development. There are no learn tests, only written deliverables. So you must test all your methods to make sure they work.
